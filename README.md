## Learnt the following:

## Protocols and Extensions:

### 1. Protocols 
  - They are rules such as properties and methods something must confirm to or must have
  
### 2. Protocol Inheritence
  - Protocols can inherit properties and methods from super protcol like classes
  - The functions in the protocol should be merely just declarations and doesnt have bodies
  - Property in protocol must have `{get}` or `{get set}`

### 3. Extensions
  - Adding your own sets of methods to the existing swift built in types to give additional functionality and lot more features
  - Also add computed properties
 
### 4. Protocol Extension
  - Same like regular extensions, functions and properties can be created for protocol extensions

### 5. Protocol Oriented Programming
  - Can give a default function using extension
  - Can declare the same protocol stub function inside stuct conforming to protcol for override
